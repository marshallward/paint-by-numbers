Paint By Numbers
================

An old gameboy game that I wrote decades ago, found it on my computer.

Paint By Numbers was a silly game for drawing based on numbers in a grid,
Joe Lafiosca introduced to me.

Will try to clean it up (makefiles etc) if I get a chance, but this was in old
Z80 assembly so only worked on the original Game Boys.
